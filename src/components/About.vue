          Hi, Iâ€™m Ryo Kitano, a second-year math student at the University of Waterloo majoring in
          Mathematical Finance and Combinatorics & Optimization. I'm passionate about applying technical and analytical
          skills in software development and quantitative research.
        </p>

        <p>
          My love for numbers actually began much earlier than university. In 3rd grade,
          I spent hours every day playing Pokemon on my 3DS. From these games, I learned to strategize by optimizing team compositions, analyzing the probability for
          shiny pokemons, and beating opponents in battles. I think my game addiction during childhood has unknowingly ingrained my passion for mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not building financial models, you'll find me watching NBA games. Basketball fascinates me because there are numbers everywhere. 
          I love the mathematical beauty in analyzing player performance and team mechanics. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Above all, I aspire to become a quant. I want to unveil the hidden patterns in financial data that are seamingly impossible to see. 
          I will continuously challenge myself both academically and as a person while being excited for what the future holds for me and the world.
